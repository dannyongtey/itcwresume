Hi <%= @recruiter_name %>,

Greetings from IT Job Expo team.

We are just one week away from the event, and we are pleased to inform that our centralised resume submission platform is ready.

The following is your credential needed for you to access the portal.

ID: <%= @recruiter_email %>

Password: <%= @password %>

Here's the direct link: https://ijeresume.herokuapp.com/resumes

In this portal, you may review candidatesâ€™ resumes, which are categorized according to the type of employment they are seeking for (full-time or internship), and whether they are Malaysian or non-Malaysian. As we get closer to the event, there will be more students submitting their resumes, so do check back often.

Should any of the candidate(s) catches your attention - you may contact them prior to the event day or even set appointment to have the interview during the IT Job Expo itself. We are providing 2 interview booths that could be utilized by any of our participating employers throughout the day. No booking required.

We are hoping that this could improve the overall experience of the event, and do let us know should you have suggestion on how to make this better.

Thank you.

Regards,
IT Job Expo Team
